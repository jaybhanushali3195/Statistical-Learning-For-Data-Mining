# Naïve Bayes classifier for wine quality dataset
<p>1)Built a naïve Bayes classifier for predicting the quality of wine data with 12 categorical variables and target variable from 0 to 10.
<p>2)Evaluated the model on the basis of Confusion Matrix and Area under ROC curve.
<p>3)Model resulted in 55% accuracy on the test data saying that this would not be a good model for such data.
<p> Technology Stack - Scikit- Learn,matplotlib,numpy </p>

# Classification of Diabetes dataset using Decision tree,SVM,Regression Tree model.
<p>1)A decision tree classifier,SVM,Regression Tree models were built and GridSearch Method was used to optimal values of parameters.
<p>2)A suitable model was selected for classification considering the tradeoff between Bias and Variance.
<p>3)The Models were evaluated on the basis of Confusion matrix,Precision, Recall and Area Under ROC.
<p>4)Decision Tree Classifier gave Testing accuracy of 71.8%,SVM -70.56%,Rregression Tree model - 35.5%
<p> Technology Stack - Scikit-learn,numpy,pandas,matplotlib,C5.0(CART)</p>

# K clustering of Diabetes dataset
<p>1)Executed K means Clustering with different values of clusters.
<p>2)Used Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters which came out to be 10.
<p>3)Executed Hierarchical Clustering with single,complete,average and wards distance.
<p>4)Used Cophenetic correlation Coefficient to compare the linkages resulting in Average linkage to be best with 0.8653.</p>
