# Naïve Bayes classifier for wine quality dataset
<p>1)Built a naïve Bayes classifier for predicting the quality of wine data with 12 categorical variables and target variable from 0 to 10.
<p>2)Evaluated the model on the basis of Confusion Matrix and Area under ROC curve.
<p>3)Model resulted in 55% accuracy on the test data saying that this would not be a good model for such data.
<p> Technology Stack - Scikit- Learn,matplotlib,numpy </p>
